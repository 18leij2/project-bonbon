Mochi: Hello, world!
Mochi_Happy: I'm the budding hero and future savior of Doh, Mochi!
Pan: And I'm Pan. Nice to meet you.
Mochi_Idle: So, what are we doing here, Pan?
Pan: We need to help the developers test out the dialogue system by pushing it to its limits, with some simple dialogue that covers every possible use case.
Mochi_Angry: What? That sounds lame! I just want to fulfill the heroic archetype that the dialogue programmer read for like two minutes from the Narrative Drive folder!
Pan: Yes, just like that! Just keep talking, and we'll be able to help the developers bake up some wonderful new systems for us to exist and thrive in!
Mochi_Happy: Where's the part where I get to fight bad guys and prove my mettle in a futile effort to cover up my insecurities and validate my worth to myself and the people in my life?
Pan_Embarassed: You might want to hop two scenes over and give it a month or two before we get to have any proper fights.
Mochi_Angry: No way! Waiting is boring.
Pan: If that's the case, you're not going to like the combat sub-genre for this game...
