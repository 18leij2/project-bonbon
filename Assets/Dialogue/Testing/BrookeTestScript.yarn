Mochi: Hello, world!
Mochi_Happy: I'm the budding hero and future savior of Doh, Mochi!
Pan: And I'm Pan. Nice to meet you.
Mochi_Idle: So, what are we doing here, Pan?
Pan: We need to help the developers test out the dialogue system by pushing it to its limits, with some simple dialogue that covers every possible use case.
Mochi_Angry: What? That sounds lame! I just want to fulfill the heroic archetype that the dialogue programmer read for like two minutes from the Narrative Drive folder!
Pan: Yes, just like that! Just keep talking, and we'll be able to help the developers bake up some wonderful new systems for us to exist and thrive in!
Mochi_Happy: Where's the part where I get to fight bad guys and prove my mettle in a futile effort to cover up my insecurities and validate my worth to myself and the people in my life?
Pan_Embarassed: You might want to hop two scenes over and give it a month or two before we get to have any proper fights.
Mochi_Angry: No way! Waiting is boring.
Pan: If that's the case, you're not going to like the combat sub-genre for this game...

// Esther: if i don't drink from this ambiguous cup of coffee/cocoa every five minutes i will actually just flatline on the spot
// Mochi_Angry: What's gotten into you? Is this some dark influence?
// Pan_Embarassed: It's like...all the tiredness and mindlessness of a programmer after six hours of hyperfocus was concentrated into one person...
// Esther: time has become a meaningless construct
// Esther: the mental stack is overflowing, the bugs are showing, the hours are going, my words free-flowing
// Esther: time to binge risk of rain 2 for twelve hours
// Pan_Idle: She's completely lost it...
Esther: blah blah blah i'm evil now
Pan_Idle: I think we're gunna have to kill this gal, Mochi.
Mochi_Angry: Damn
